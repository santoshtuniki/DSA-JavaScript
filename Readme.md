#### Big-O-Guide

##### Calculation independent of input size = O(1)

##### loop = O(n)

##### nested-loop = O(n^2)

##### Input reduced by half = O(log n)

##### Bubble Sort 
    
    Repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

##### Insertion Sort

    Iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list.

    Initially first element alone is taken as sorted portion & remaining as unsorted.

##### Quick Sort

    Divide and Conquer algorithm 
    
    Picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.

##### Merge Sort


------

##### Stable Sort

    if two elements have the same key, their relative order will be preserved in the sorted output
